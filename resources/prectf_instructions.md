## Assigned Teams


Hi Everyone! Please take a look at your assigned teams and sign up for a TryHackMe account, if you haven't done so already.
I have listed your team members down below and randomly assigned a leader.
In order for THM to keep track of your teams scores, the leader must create a group on THM.

## To do that:
1. Log into TryHackMe
2. Click on your profile > Manage Account > CTF Teams
3. Create the team and add your group members


** = Team Leader

| CyberTeam 1   | CyberTeam 2      | CyberTeam 3      |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |

| Mason Webb    | Ben Heng         | Jacob Valdivia   |
| Tommy Yang    | Luke Kimes       | Luke Gutierrez   |

To get started with the lab:

1. Navigate to `login.microsoftonline.com` or `myapps.microsoft.com`
2. You will have access to all your apps, feel free to look around for some of the CTF.
3. Familiarize yourself with the log analytics workspace.
